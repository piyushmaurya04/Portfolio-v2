## 4. Professional Experience

### Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) — System Engineer

**Enterprise Client Account | Mumbai, India | Jan 2025 – Present**

- Enhanced an enterprise web application (PSS) by implementing new business features and fixing production defects, improving overall application stability and reliability.
- Designed and built **four Spring Boot Kafka consumer services** ingesting real-time distributor data across environment-specific topics, each processed via **3 parallel partitions per topic**; the initial production load of **70K–93K messages per topic** was consumed and persisted successfully within seconds of deployment.
- Implemented **eventId-based deduplication** against Oracle stored procedures (UPSERT/DELETE) to guarantee exactly-once writes, with full schema validation before persistence.
- Architected a **two-tier fault-tolerance strategy** — Spring-managed in-memory retry (5 attempts, 1-min backoff) for transient errors, plus immediate DLQ routing with throttled email alerts for malformed messages — and a **scheduled DLQ reprocessor** (every 2 hrs, up to 12 retries) that eliminated manual intervention and prevented data loss.
- Secured all Kafka connections with **OAuth (SASL_SSL)** and **Conjur-managed credentials** in Kubernetes, deployed consistently across four environments (DEV/LT/STG/PRD).
- Performed testing and validation during a **Teradata-to-Snowflake data migration** as part of an Agile team.
- Self-deployed all implementations to production by independently following the client's production deployment lifecycle end-to-end.

## 5. Projects

### Tenant & Owner Management System (TOM) — _In Progress_

**Tech Stack:** Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA (Hibernate), MySQL, Maven
**Planned:** Spring Security (JWT), React, Python/FastAPI

- Designed a normalized relational schema and REST APIs for an owner-managed property platform (Users, Properties, Leases), with correct JPA relationship ownership modeling and tenant-code-based lease linking.
- Engineered an **anniversary-based, idempotent rent-billing engine** using Spring Boot's `@Scheduled`, generating monthly invoices in arrears with month-end date clamping and duplicate-prevention via a DB unique constraint + application-level check.
- Implemented owner-configurable late-fee logic (grace period + per-day fine) and a **payment-lifecycle state machine** (PENDING → LATE → AWAITING_APPROVAL → PAID) for online and owner-approved cash payments.
- Designed dues/balance as a **computed aggregate** over unpaid rent rows rather than a stored total, avoiding data staleness and keeping financial calculations server-side.
- Planning JWT authentication with per-user data isolation, a React frontend, and a Python/FastAPI microservice using **LLM function-calling** for natural-language queries over the user's own data.

### Netflix Clone

**Tech:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

- A replica of the Netflix UI focused on frontend web development techniques.
- **Repo:** https://github.com/piyushmaurya04/Netflix-Clone-

- A responsive Myntra clone with dynamic product listings, interactive shopping cart, user authentication, and add-to-bag functionality.
- **Repo:** (to be added)

## 9. Proposed Structure for the New Website

1. **Hero** — Name, title (Software Engineer | Java · Spring Boot · Kafka), CTA (View Work / Contact / Download Resume)
2. **About** — professional summary + quick highlights (TCS, TCS GEMS Award)
3. **Experience** — TCS timeline with the Kafka achievements
4. **Skills** — grouped (Languages, Backend & Messaging, DevOps, Frontend & DB, Practices)
5. **Projects** — TOM (featured) + Netflix Clone + Weather App + Myntra Clone
6. **Achievements** — awards, coding profiles (LeetCode / CodeChef / HackerRank)
7. **Contact** — email, phone, social links, resume download, contact form

### Design & Tech Recommendations

- **Stack:** Static website — HTML, CSS, JavaScript (fast, easy to host on Netlify/GitHub Pages).
- **Theme:** modern dark/light toggle, clean typography, subtle animations.
- **Must-haves:** responsive, accessible (a11y), SEO meta + Open Graph, fast load.
- **Extras:** live demo links, downloadable resume PDF, smooth scroll navigation.

## 10. Build Plan

- **Type:** Static website (no backend build step required for hosting).
- **All projects kept:** TOM (featured) + Netflix Clone + Weather App + Myntra Clone.
- **All links kept:** LinkedIn, GitHub, Instagram, X, LeetCode, CodeChef, HackerRank + project repos.

### Open Questions (nice to confirm, not blocking)

1. Which email to show — `piyush.maurya0410@gmail.com` (resume) or `piyushmaurya0410@gmail.com` (old site)?
2. Do you have a new resume PDF to link for download?
3. Any brand colors / design preference (minimal, colorful, dark, etc.)?
